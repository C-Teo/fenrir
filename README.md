# fenrir

A fast, readable, and memory-safe programming language built with Rust.

Fenrir is a statically-typed language designed to strike a balance between performance, elegance, and safety. Inspired by modern language design and forged in the speed and rigor of Rust, Fenrir empowers developers to write expressive, efficient, and reliable code—without sacrificing clarity.
